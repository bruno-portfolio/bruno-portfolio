# Agronomist | Agricultural Data & Workflow Automation

Bridging Agronomic Science and Data Technology. With a background from **UFV** and 3 years of experience in process optimization at **IBM**, I build practical, production-minded solutions for the AgTech ecosystem.

I focus on engineering rigor and delivery, clear problem framing, reproducible pipelines, and documentation that makes tools easy to run, evaluate, and maintain. I leverage modern tooling to accelerate research and prototyping without compromising correctness or maintainability.
